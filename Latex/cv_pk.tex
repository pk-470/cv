% Intro
\cvitem{}{
	I am an Artificial Intelligence Engineer based in the Netherlands. I am currently working part-time for Cordys Analytics, a startup affiliated with the University Medical Center Utrecht which applies A.I. methods for the purpose of diagnosing heart disease from electrocardiograms (ECGs). At the same time, I am working on my thesis for the Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence at Maastricht University, researching the use of State-Space models (Mamba) trained on bio-acoustic data for the purpose of monitoring animal populations. I have a strong background in Mathematics, having completed a bachelor's and master's in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. I am mainly interested in A.I. with applications to engineering and healthcare.

\section{Professional experience}

\cventry[1em]{Sep. 2024 - Today}{A.I. Engineer}{Cordys Analytics}{Utrecht, NL}{}{
    After completing a 6-month internship for Cordys Analytics, I started working with them as a part-time A.I. Engineer.

}

\cventry[1em]{Mar. 2024 - Aug. 2024}{A.I. Intern}{}{}{}{
    During my internship, I focused on the topic of "Noise Detection and Uncertainty Estimation in ECGs," applying deep learning techniques to identify noisy electrocardiograms. My main contributions and takeaways include:
	\begin{itemize}
		\itemizeItem I familiarized myself with Out Of Distribution (OOD) detection methods and implemented various techniques from recent literature to improve the robustness and reliability of ECG noise detection models.
		\itemizeItem I designed and conducted various experiments, testing different models on public and private ECG datasets to evaluate and optimize the performance of noise detection algorithms.
		\itemizeItem I gained firsthand experience in the dynamic startup environment at Cordys.
		\itemizeItem I actively contributed to Cordy's ECGxAI package, a useful tool in the analysis and interpretation of ECG data using deep learning methods.
	\end{itemize}
	My strong performance and good work ethic during my internship resulted in me getting hired for a part-time A.I. Engineering role in the same company.
