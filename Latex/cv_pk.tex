\cvitem[0.8em]{}{
	I am a Cambridge Mathematics graduate currently between my first and second year of a two year master's in Artificial Intelligence at Maastricht University. After finishing my bachelor's and first master's in Mathematics I started working as a math tutor. At the same time, I independently developed my programming skills in Python and took online courses on the basics of Artificial Intelligence. I am currently looking for an AI related internship.
}


\section{Education}

\cventry[0.8em]{2022 -}{Master's in Artificial Intelligence}{Maastricht University}{}{}{
	So far I have completed courses in topics such as Search Algorithms, Deep Learning, Autonomous Robotics Systems, Computer Vision and Text Mining. In the next periods I am planning to take courses on Data Mining, Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning. Additionally, as a part of my degree I participated in two research group projects.
}

\cventry[0.8em]{2017 - 2021}{Master of Mathematics \normalfont{(bachelor's \& integrated master's)}}{University of Cambridge}{}{67/100}{
	In my two final years of study I mainly focused on Logic and Combinatorics, taking courses such as: Model Theory (on which I wrote my master's thesis), Topics in Combinatorics, Ramsey Theory, Additive Combinatorics, Logic and Set Theory, Graph Theory. Other topics I have taken include: Differential Equations, Statistics, Linear Algebra, Number Theory, Group/Ring/Module Theory, Real and Complex Analysis, Topology, Probability and Measure Theory, Linear Analysis, Differential Geometry, Riemman Surfaces.
}

\cventry[0.8em]{2014 - 2017}{Apolytirion of Geniko Lykeio \normalfont{(high-school diploma)}}{Mandoulides Schools}{}{19.9/20}{
	Due to my strong performance in school exams as well as extracuriccular maths and physics competitions (most notably winning a bronze medal in the 18th Junior Balkan Mathematical Olympiad, a gold medal in the 31st Greek Junior National Mathematical Olympiad and the first place in the 25th Panhellenic Physics Competition) I received a full scholarship throughout my years of study in Mandoulides Schools.
}

}

\cvitem[0.8em]{\textbullet}{
	\textbf{MATLAB} (competent): I have used MATLAB extensively in various projects for my degree in Mathematics.
}

\cvitem[0.8em]{\textbullet}{
	\textbf{Linux} (intermediate): I am familiar with Ubuntu and I have written a number of Bash scripts to automate various tasks or customize Ubuntu's behaviour and appearance.
}

\cvitem[0.8em]{\textbullet}{
	\textbf{HTML} and \textbf{CSS} (intermediate): I have learned some HTML and CSS through the online web development course ``The Odin Project".
}

\cvitem[0.8em]{\textbullet}{
	\textbf{\LaTeX} \ (competent): I regularly use Latex to write technical and non-technical documents.
}


\section{Selected projects from my A.I.\ master's:}

\cventry[0.8em]{2023}{Action and Path Planning for Environment-Aware and Collision-Free Object Manipulation}{}{}{}{
	The aim of this group project was to automate the manipulation of small objects by a robotic arm. This task involves three main components:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[\textbullet] building a representation of the environment using 3D computer vision techniques;
		\item[\textbullet] identifying optimal grasping position for each object;
		\item[\textbullet] planning the path of the robotic arm towards the target position.
	\end{itemize}

\cventry[0.8em]{2022 - 2023}{Automatic Music Sheet Page Turner}{}{
	\faGithub\ \href{https://github.com/csotogd/Music-Score-Localization-2.0}{\protect\path{csotogd/Music-Score-Localization-2.0}}}{}{
	Our group developed an algorithm with the aim to localize a recorded song snippet as played by a human within the music score of the entire song. Our algorithm is based on the one developed for the app Shazam, while also including techniques such as Monte-Carlo Robot Localization.
}

\cventry[0.8em]{2022}{Impasse AI}{}{
	\faGithub\ \href{https://github.com/pk-470/impasse-ai}{\protect\path{pk-470/impasse-ai}}}{}{
	I created a search engine for the game Impasse by Mark Steere which uses Alpha-Beta search along with move ordering, iterative deepening and a transposition table. When matched with the engines of my classmates in a tournament my engine came 3rd overall, surpassing many engines which could search deeper within the allowed time due to being written in languages faster than Python.

\section{Selected computational projects from my Mathematics bachelor's:}

\cventry[0.8em]{2020}{Graph Colouring}{}{}{}{
	I studied and implemented on MATLAB various techniques for efficiently bounding the chromatic number of a graph.
}

\cventry[0.8em]{2019}{Simulation of Random Samples	from Parametric Distributions}{}{}{}{
	I used MATLAB to study and visualise the behaviour of random variables sampled from various distributions (exponential, gamma, normal, chi-squared).
}

\cventry[0.8em]{2018}{Ordinary Differential Equations}{}{}{}{
	I used MATLAB to study and compare three methods for solving ODEs (Leapfrog, Euler, RK4).
